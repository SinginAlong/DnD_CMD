# DnD_CMD
Practicing Python class inheritance by making a dungeons and dragons 5e program.  Not really sure it's useful, but it's fun to work on.

Definitely not working as intented at the moment.  
I don't really have a good idea of what is intended.
I'm mostly just putting this here so I can access it easily at any time.
